# Initial note from 20th August, 2019

I have been dabbling in LaTeX after teaching myself the basics of mathmode in Spring of 2017.  After discovering TeXStudio in early 2018, it got to early Autumn of 2019 where I made my first macros.  In June, 2019, my laptop was stolen, and with a lack of a knowledge of GitHub, my macros were lost.  In the Winter break between semesters, I began developing my LaTeX macros again, and since then have been adding to them.  Alas, the changes I have made from creating my_macros for the second time, and now, are beyond the scope of this text.  However, let it be known that from this day forth, after learning the basics of Git, that I would like to record my changes to my_macros using Git!
