# LaTeX Macros

This repository will show the progression of my macros used on LaTeX, in order to **a)** keep track of history of my macros, and **b)** extend my (currently limited) knowledge of Git and GitHub.  I hope that this provides good coding practice for any future coding-related endeavours.

## Usage
See templates.

Three main directories exist in this repository.  One for general macros in everyday use, with my favourite font (garamond; see below for how to obtain on a Mac).  One is an American Psychology Association format, in Times New Roman Font, and APA-style bibliography.  Finally, we have a directory for some templates using these.  Happy LaTeX-ing!
